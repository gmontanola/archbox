# archbox

## Description

This is my personal development box. Basically a container with my tooling stack to use with [distrobox](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox).
If you to build your own just generate a template from [boxkit](https://github.com/ublue-os/boxkit) and read the **README** there.

## Motivation

After using Archlinux for 4 years straight I decided to try [Fedora Kinoite](https://fedoraproject.org/kinoite/) so I can experiment
with an immutable OS.

Using an OS like Fedora Kinoite means you avoid installing programs in your base OS and move to:

* **Flatpak** for GUI stuff
* **distrobox** for CLI stuff and things that are not _flatpacked_

I choose to use Archlinux as my **distrobox** base image because [AUR (Arch User Repository)](https://aur.archlinux.org/) is really complete.

## Packages

_TODO_
